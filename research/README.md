# Topic areas in eye tracking
# Methodology: Eye tracking allows us to observe the eye movements of programmers while reading code. Unlike subjective reports, with eyetracking we have an objective and precise measure for observing programmers. Therefore, eye tracking is becoming increasingly popular in research in software engineering.

As part of your thesis, you will design and carry out an eye tracking study yourself. We provide templates and hardware. Depending on the topic, you have to develop the precise tasks and content.


The analysis and visualization of the collected data is done either with special software (e.g. Ogama) or own scripts (e.g. Python). For this purpose, dimensions such as saccade length, fixation duration, regressions, reading order or pupil size are calculated and compared.


Topic 1: How does code quality affect understanding and maintenance of code?
Code can be difficult to understand due to too many execution paths, too long methods, or too many variables. What are the appropriate limit values ​​as of when code is no longer understandable and waiting?


Topic 2: After how many semesters of study do students read code as well as professional programmers?
Experienced programmers typically read code in order of execution, while novice programmers read code from top to bottom. But when does programming beginners change the reading order? The reading order is recorded and analyzed using eye tracking.


Topic 3: How do code structures (e.g. grinding vs. recursion) affect program understanding?
Each algorithm can be written as a loop or recursively. But what is easier for the programmer to understand? In this work, you examine the effects of code structures on the comprehensibility of code, especially depending on the prior knowledge of the test subjects.


Topic 4: What are the most challenging programs that fit in 30 lines? When are programmers stressed?
The mental stress is examined using eye tracking. The results will then complement coding conventions.


# Thematic areas in the fMRI
# Methodology: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows the brain to “watch while we work”. In an accurate 3D image, we record brain activity while solving a task. The activated areas can then be assigned to cognitive functions and help us to understand cognitive processes more precisely.

If helpful, in addition to fMRI, eye movements can also be recorded with an eye tracker, as well as physiological data (e.g. heartbeat, breathing).


As part of your thesis, you will design and conduct an fMRI study independently. We provide templates and hardware. Depending on the topic, you have to develop the precise tasks and content.


The analysis and visualization of the collected data is done either with special software (e.g. BrainVoyager) or with your own scripts (e.g. with FSL). It analyzes where and to what extent the brain activates (or deactivates) the programmer.


Topic 5: Do you learn a new foreign language just like a new programming language?
Of course not, you would say, but did you know that understanding code and understanding natural language activate the same brain areas? Here, participants would learn parts of a new foreign language and a programming language, with brain activity being recorded using fMRI.


Topic 6: Can machine learning / deep learning algorithms differentiate new and experienced programmers based on brain activation?
The assessment of programming experience e.g. in the context of an interview remains a challenge in the IT industry. A study found evidence that brain activation changes with increasing experience. In this thesis, they analyze already recorded fMRI data using machine learning algorithms and determine whether the participants' experience can be derived from brain activation.
